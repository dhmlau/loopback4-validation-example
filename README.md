# loopback4-validation

An example application to demonstrate validation in LoopBack.

## Summary

This application shows how to add validation in a LoopBack application. It exposes `/coffee-shops` endpoints to create/read/update/delete a CoffeeShop instance with the in-memory storage.

### Key artifacts

- [CoffeeShop model](src/models/coffee-shop.model.ts)
  - Shows how to add validation using [AJV](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv)
- [ValidatePhoneNumInterceptor](src/interceptors/validate-phone-num.interceptor.ts) and [CoffeeShopController](src/controllers/coffee-shop.controller.ts)
  - Shows how to add reusable validation logic in interceptors

## Use

Start the app:

```sh
npm start
```

The application will start on port 3000. Open http://localhost:3000/explorer in your browser. You can try to test the validation for the `/coffee-shops` endpoints.
